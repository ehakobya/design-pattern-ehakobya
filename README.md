#### For this project I could use decorator pattern to allow a code-a-mon to gain new abilities when they level up

#### Also I could use a factory pattern to create and instantiate different kindo of code-a-mon.

#### Mediator pattern could be used to provide communication between objects. Instaed of objects communication with each other, all object communication goes through the mediator.
